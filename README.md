# fp-oauth-ser v0.1
With this project I will be making an authorization server which will implement the Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant.

At this I do not want to do authentication with this project.  Clients should find some other authentication means (... watch me to make that project as well ...)  

I'll be trying to follow [this book](https://aaronparecki.com/oauth-2-simplified/) and [this guide](http://www.bubblecode.net/en/2016/01/22/understanding-oauth2/), so thank you to those authors.
